        <p class="about-text">
            I am João Rebouças, a postdoctoral researcher in observational cosmology at Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas (CBPF) in Rio de Janeiro. I'm from Recife, Pernambuco, Brasil, where I graduated in Physics at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in 2020.
            <br>
            
            <br>
            I started my PhD in observational cosmology in 2020 - when the COVID-19 pandemic started - at Instituto de Física Teórica - UNESP (IFT-UNESP), with professor Rogério Rosenfeld as my advisor. I began working with professor Vivian Miranda, who was a postdoc at University of Arizona at the time and then became professor at Stony Brook University. During my PhD, I learned about observational cosmology and started developing projects that analyzed extended dark energy models with large-scale structure data, in particular 2-point correlation functions from galaxy surveys, in the context of the Hubble and \( S_8 \) tensions. I concluded my PhD in Februrary 2025.
            <br>
            
            <br>
            I then got accepted as a postdoctoral researcher at CBPF, where I am currently working as of March 2025. I conduct several projects within the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) collaborations regarding extended cosmological models. I also conduct projects with several research groups from CBPF, IFT-UNESP, Stony Brook University and University of Arizona.
