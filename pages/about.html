        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my academic website! I am João Rebouças, a postdoctoral researcher in physics.</p>
        <p>My research focuses on observational cosmology: how to extract information about the cosmological model using multiple observables, including CMB anisotropies, supernovae luminosity distances, and galaxy surveys.</p>
        <p>I graduated in Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in 2020. Through Fapesp's direct doctorate scholarship, I started my PhD in observational cosmology in 2020, at Instituto de Física Teórica - UNESP, concluding in 2025.</p>
        <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects studying extended cosmological models beyond Lambda-CDM. In particular, I studied scalar field quintessence, early dark energy, late-time dynamical dark energy and interactions between dark matter and dark energy. These models are constrained using multiple probes, and model selection criteria are employed to find out which is the best cosmological model.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my research, publications, and contact me for any inquiries!</p>
