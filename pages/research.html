        <h1>Research Interests</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my research page! Here you can find information about my current research interests and projects.</p>
        
        <h2>Observational Cosmology</h2>
        <p>
            My research focuses on observational cosmology, a field that relates theoretical cosmological predictions with astronomical observables, using data analysis techniques to extract information about the theoretical model properties. Some of the main cosmological probes include: luminosity distances to Type-Ia, Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies, and data from galaxy surveys, in particular 2-point correlation functions and distances measured using the baryon acoustic oscillation scale.
        </p>

        <h2>The Hubble Tension</h2>
        <p>
            The Hubble tension refers to the discrepancy between the value of the Hubble constant \(H_0\) measured from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the value obtained from local distance ladder measurements. This tension has significant implications for our understanding of cosmology and may indicate new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology.
        </p>

        <h2>The \( S_8 \) Tension</h2>
        <p>
            The \( S_8 \) tension refers to the discrepancy between the value of the parameter \( S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3} \) measured from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the value obtained from galaxy surveys.
        </p>
