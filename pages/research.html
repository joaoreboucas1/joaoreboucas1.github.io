        <h1>Research Interests</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my research page! Here you can find information about my current research interests and projects.</p>
        
        <h2>Observational Cosmology</h2>
        <p>
            My research focuses on observational cosmology, a field that relates theoretical cosmological predictions with astronomical observables, using data analysis techniques to extract information about the theoretical model properties. Some of the main cosmological probes include: luminosity distances to Type-Ia, Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies, and data from galaxy surveys, in particular 2-point correlation functions and distances measured using the baryon acoustic oscillation scale.
        </p>

        <h2>The Hubble Tension</h2>
        <p>
            The Hubble tension refers to the discrepancy between the value of the Hubble constant \(H_0\) measured from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the value obtained from local distance ladder measurements. This tension has significant implications for our understanding of cosmology and may indicate new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology.
        </p>

        <h2>The \( S_8 \) Tension</h2>
        <p>
            The \( S_8 \) tension refers to the discrepancy between the value of the parameter \( S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3} \) measured from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the value obtained from galaxy surveys.
        </p>

        <h2>Dynamical Dark Energy Hints</h2>
        <p>
            Besides cosmological tensions, recent observations, in particular luminosity distances to Type-Ia supernovae from Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5, alongside measurements of the BAO scale from the DESI collaboration, suggest a possible deviation from the standard cosmological model of a cosmological constant (\( \Lambda \)CDM). This deviation is characterized by a dynamical dark energy equation of state \( w(z) \) that evolves with redshift according to the \( w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a) \). The current data hints at a value of \( w_0 \approx -0.8 \) and \( w_a \approx -0.8 \), which is significantly different from the standard value of -1. The best-fit \( w_0w_a \) model can fit the data better than \( \Lambda \)CDM with significances ranging from \( 2.8 - 4.2\sigma \). See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14738">DESI DR2 Results II:Measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Cosmological Constraints</a> for more details.
        </p>

        <h2>Physics Beyond \(\Lambda\)CDM</h2>
        <p>
            Due to these observational problems in \(\Lambda\)CDM, the scientific community is actively investigating possible extensions to the standard model of cosmology. These extensions include modifications to the dark energy equation of state, such as dynamical dark energy models, and modifications to gravity, such as f(R) gravity and scalar-tensor theories. The goal is to find a theoretical framework that can explain the observed tensions and provide a more complete understanding of the Universe's evolution.
