            <h1>Research Interests</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my research page! Here you can find information about my current research interests and projects.</p>
            
            <h2>Observational Cosmology</h2>
            <p>
                My research focuses on observational cosmology, a field that relates theoretical cosmological predictions with astronomical observables. I use data analysis techniques to extract from data information about the theoretical model properties, including: the expansion history of the Universe, the evolution of the matter distribution across the Universe, inflationary physics, neutrino masses and their hierarchy, dark energy and dark matter properties.

            <h2>The \( \Lambda \)CDM Model</h2>
            <p>
                The current model for the expansion of the Universe assumes that: gravity is governed by General Relativity; the Universe is made of the particles comprising the Standard Model of Particle Physics; there exists a cold dark matter (CDM) component that behaves as pressureless matter; there exists a cosmological constant \( \Lambda \) in the Einstein equations; after the Big Bang, the Universe had an early phase of accelerated expansion. These assumptions are enough to determine the expansion history and evolution of the matter distribution (assumed mostly homogeneous with small, linear perturbations) across the Universe. This model has five free parameters: the current expansion rate of the Universe, \( H_0 \); the current relative amount of CDM and baryonic matter in the Universe, \( \Omega_m \) and \( \Omega_b \); two parameters describing the power spectrum of initial perturbations, \( A_s \) and \( n_s \). Additionally, to predict anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background, one needs the optical depth of reionization \( \tau \). Despite being a very simple model, it succeeds in accurately descibing most cosmological probes.
            </p>
            <h2>Cosmological Probes</h2>
            <p>
                Multiple astrophysical observations support the \( \Lambda \)CDM paradigm. Some examples are:
                <ul>
                    <li> Type Ia supernovae: these are star explosions with a known physical mechanism. Since they all are almost equally bright, they can be used as standard candles, meaning that we are able to consistently measure the expansion of the Universe by measuring their brightnesses and redshifts. </li>
                    <li> Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies: the CMB are photons created right after the Big Bang. In the early Universe, these photons were tightly coupled with electrons via Thomson scattering. After the formation of the first atoms, these photons became free to travel across the Universe, eventually reaching us. The photons were in thermal equilibrium, and today track an almost isotropic, almost perfect blackbody radiation with temperature \( T_\mathrm{CMB} = 2.7255 \mathrm{K} \). Its temperature and polarization anisotropies encode information about pre-recombination physics, such as the size of the photon-baryon acoustic horizon. </li>
                    <li> Galaxy surveys: mapping redshifts, angular positions and shapes of millions of galaxies. We can extract information about cosmology in multiple ways. One of them is by using the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation feature, a peak in their 2-point correlation function that occurs at a specific separation: the acoustic horizon at baryon drag epoch. This scale is used as a ruler to measure the distance to the measured galaxy sample. Another technique is to use the angular 2-point correlation functions of galaxy positions, shapes and their cross-correlation. The former is used to track the expansion of the Universe, while the latter measures the large-scale structure formed by the matter distribution. </li>
                </ul>
                Cosmological data analysis leverages synergies among different observables to place tight constraints on the values of \( \Lambda \)CDM model parameters.
            </p>

            <h2>The Hubble and \(S_8 \) Tensions</h2>
            <p>
                The increase in precision has led to disagreements between different observables in terms of predicted values of cosmological parameters. There are two tensions that attracted attention from the cosmological community: the Hubble tension and the \(S_8 \) tension.
                <br>
                The Hubble tension is the discrepancy between measurements of the Hubble constant \(H_0\) from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and from local distance ladder measurements. Using state-of-the-art datasets, the statistical significance of this tension reaches the \( 5 \sigma \) level. This tension has significant implications for our understanding of cosmology and may indicate new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology.
                <br>
                The \( S_8 \) tension refers to the discrepancy between the value of the parameter \( S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3} \) measured from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the value obtained from galaxy surveys. Its statistical significance varies depending on the datasets considered and the systematic error treatment employed in the analysis, fluctuating from below \( 1\sigma \) up to \( 3\sigma\).
            </p>

            <h2>Dynamical Dark Energy Hints</h2>
            <p>
                Besides cosmological tensions, recent geometric datasets suggest a deviation from the standard cosmological model of a cosmological constant (\( \Lambda \)CDM). This deviation can be characterized by a dynamical dark energy equation of state \( w \) that evolves with redshift according to the \( w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a) \). In this parametrization, the cosmological constant can be recovered by setting \( w_0 = -1 \) and \( w_a = 0\); however, current data prefers values of \( w_0 \approx -0.8 \) and \( w_a \approx -0.8 \). The best-fit \( w_0w_a \) model can fit the data better than \( \Lambda \)CDM with significances ranging from \( 2.8 - 4.2\sigma \). See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14738" target="_blank">DESI DR2 Results II: Measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Cosmological Constraints</a> for more details.

            <h2>Physics Beyond \(\Lambda\)CDM</h2>
            <p>
                Due to these observational problems in \(\Lambda\)CDM, the scientific community is actively investigating possible extensions to the standard model of cosmology. These extensions include modifications to the dark energy equation of state, such as dynamical dark energy models, and modifications to gravity, such as f(R) gravity and scalar-tensor theories. The goal is to find a theoretical framework able to bring different datasets into concordance and provide a more complete understanding of the Universe's evolution, gravity, the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and inflationary physics.
